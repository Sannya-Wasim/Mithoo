  We hope this message finds you well. As a valued member of our online pet shop
  community, we want to keep you informed and engaged in our mission to ensure

  Introducing "Monthly Pet Watch" - our initiative to raise awareness about
  missing and stolen pets in our community. Every month, we compile a
  comprehensive report highlighting the pets that have gone missing or have been
  stolen during that period. We believe that by coming together and spreading
  the word, we can increase the chances of reuniting these beloved companions
  with their families.
</p>

  month:
